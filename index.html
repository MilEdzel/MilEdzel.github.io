                    <h2>H I!</h2> 
                    <p>My name is EDZEL B. LIM. I am 21 years old And My Birthday is March 30, 2000. I live in Quezon City. My Hobbies is Watching Movies, Youtube, Online games, Basketball, Surfing Internet, and cooking. My old school was senior high school at Abe International Business College. I studied there for 2 years and my major is ICT stands for Information and Communication Technology. I am Always Active of My old school. My strength is that I know how to get along with other people and my weakness is that I am shy when I am in front of many people like the contest ect. 
                        I'm ashamed of such things but I do everything to improve myself and eliminate my weakness in such things. So I chose IT because I love online games or editing but I'm not that good at editing. IT because somehow I know something about technology and I will do everything to expand my knowledge of technology, What I don't expect in IT plus 1 (Computer Hardware) about the system and assembling computers like cpu.</p>
